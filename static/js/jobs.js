            description: "Hi!  I am looking for someone to watch my two daughters occasionally on Wednesday and Friday mornings- I have a project that I am taking and there are a couple times where my regular sitter (my mom) can't get to my house until after I need to leave.  I live in NW Evanston, a few blocks from Ryan field.  My 1 year old will most likely be asleep for some, if not all of the time, so basically you would just need to play with my 3 year old!  Please let me know if you are interested and would love to have you meet my girls.  Thanks!!",
